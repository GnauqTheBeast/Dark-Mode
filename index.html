                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Improved readability:</strong> Light mode can be easier to read for some people, especially those with certain visual impairments. This is because the light background and dark text creates a higher contrast,
                        which makes it easier to focus on the text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Better focus:</strong>
                        Light mode can help to improve focus by reducing distractions. This is because the lighter background can help to draw attention to the content of the screen, making it easier to ignore other elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>More positive mood:</strong>
                        Light mode can create a more positive mood. This is because it is associated with sunlight and daytime, which can be uplifting and energizing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane">
                <h2>Dark Mode</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reduced eye strain:</strong> Dark mode can help to reduce eye strain by reducing the amount of light that is emitted from the screen. This is because the dark background reflects less light back into the
                        eyes, which can help to prevent fatigue and discomfort.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Improved battery life:</strong>
                        Dark mode can help to reduce eye strain by reducing the amount of light that is emitted from the screen. This is because the dark background reflects less light back into the eyes, which can help to prevent fatigue
                        and discomfort.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Less disruptive to sleep: </strong>
                        Dark mode can help to reduce the disruption to sleep by reducing the amount of blue light that is emitted from the screen. Blue light is known to interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps to
                        regulate sleep.
